    "In the context of evaluating machine learning models, the F-test by George W. Snedecor [1] can be regarded as analogous to Cochran's Q test that can be applied to evaluate multiple classifiers (i.e., whether their accuracies estimated on a test set differ) as described by Looney [2][3]. \n",

    "\n",
    "Let $\\{C_1, \\dots , C_M\\}$ be a set of classifiers which have all been tested on the same dataset. If the $M$ classifiers do not perform differently, then the F statistic is distributed according to an F distribution with $(M-1)$ and $(M-1)\\times n$ degrees of freedom, where $n$ is the number of examples in the test set. The calculation of the F statistic consists of several components, which are listed below (adopted from [2]).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by defining  $ACC_{avg}$ as the average of the accuracies of the different models\n",

    "The sum of squares for the objects is calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "SSB= \\frac{1}{M} \\sum_{j=1}^n (M_j)^2 - M\\cdot n \\cdot ACC_{avg}^2.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $M_j$ is the number of classifiers out of $M$ that correctly classified object $\\mathbf{x}_j \\in \\mathbf{X}_{n}$, where $$\\mathbf{X}_{n} = \\{\\mathbf{x}_1, ... \\mathbf{x}_{n}\\}$$ is the test dataset on which the classifiers are tested on.\n",

    "After computing the F-value, we can then look up the p-value from a F-distribution table for the corresponding degrees of freedom or obtain it computationally from a cumulative F-distribution function. In practice, if we successfully rejected the null hypothesis at a previously chosen significance threshold, we could perform multiple post hoc pair-wise tests -- for example, McNemar tests with a Bonferroni correction -- to determine which pairs have different population proportions.\n",
